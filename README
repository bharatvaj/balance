payredu

பேரேடு
======

payredu is a cross-platform frontend to ledger(pta) with emphasis on simplicity. payredu means ledger in Tamil. It is written in c99 and works on top of nuklear making it lightweight and fast.

NOTE: The quality of the software is beta in the least, it's still in development.

To build and run,

	$ make
	$ ./payredu

Why payredu when ledger-cli exists?
------------------------------------

ledger-cli by itself is pretty lightweight but it has a handful of dependencies and features which I don't particularly care about.

payredu follows a very suckless approach to ledger and does NOT provide some of the advanced features ledger provides.

It should be noted that payredu is usually faster than ledger-cli as it does not provide some of the niceties that ledger-cil provides.

Goals
-----
- Compact as possible
- Limited regex, ^,$ and *
- BSD style arguments
- Native Windows support
- csv, emacs export/import

Non-Goals
---------
- Python support
- Elaborate regex
- limited REPL
- XML support

Build
-----

	make hot

will generate 'hot' which can be used to test the hot-reload functionality with GUI for development.
This is may be removed in feature to provide only a CUI interface.
